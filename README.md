General information about myself

I'm a second-year student in Mid-State Technical College's IT Security Specialist program. I am an aspiring cyber security professional that takesÂ joy in problem-solving, whether it is for assignments in class or everyday challenges.

Technical skills I have include the use of debian linux (Kali + Ubuntu), some PowerShell scripting, cisco networking, usage of VMware Workstation + VirtualBox, some server administration knowledge, and cyber security and information security knowledge.

My future career goals involve me being in a workplace where I am not only happy with what I do but am passionate about what I am doing. If I am in that position I will be satisfied.
